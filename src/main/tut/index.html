# Type Classes from the Ground Up

Nicolas Rinaudo â€¢ [`@NicolasRinaudo`](https://twitter.com/NicolasRinaudo) â€¢ [ioSquare](http://iosquare.com)

---

## Goals

* Understand what purpose type classes serve
* Get a feel for implicit composition

--

## Running example: CSV parser

CSV data is composed of rows and columns

```csv
1,Nicolas,Rinaudo
2,Jessica,Jones
3,Matt,Murdock
```

---

## Simple CSV parser

```tut:silent
def parseCsv(input: String): List[List[String]] =
  input.split('\n').toList.map(_.split(",").toList)
```

We purposefully ignore the following flaws:

* cannot handle "complex" CSV data
* inefficient, both in terms of CPU and memory

---

## Basic example: raw numbers

```tut:book
val input = "1,2,3\n4,5,6\n7,8,9"
```

--

Running the parser yields:

```tut:book
parseCsv(input)
```

--

<!-- COMMENT -->

Representing clear numeric values as `String`s is unsatisfactory.

---

## Improvement: mapping to `Int`

```tut:book
parseCsv(input).map(_.map(_.toInt))
```

--

Not very practical: you have to manually parse `Int`s every time.

---

## Decoding CSV: first attempt

Usual answer to making reusable code: Î»-functions

```tut:silent
def decodeCsv[A](input: String)(f: String â‡’ A): List[List[A]] =
  parseCsv(input).map(_.map(f))
```

--

Running the decoder yields:

```tut:book
decodeCsv(input)(_.toInt)
```

--

<!-- COMMENT -->

Better, but not great: one has have to manually convert the value to the desired type every time.

---

## Small detour: implicits

<!-- COMMENT: using the word implicit to describe implicits seems sub-optiomal? -->

> When a function expects a parameter of type `T` _and_ that parameter is marked as implicit _and_ there exists a
> value of type `T` marked as implicit in scope, then the compiler can use that value automatically.

--

Example:

```tut:silent
implicit val a: Int = 2

def printInt(implicit i: Int): Unit = println(i)
```

--

Running `printInt` without a parameter:

```tut:book
printInt
```

<!-- COMMENT: It *might* be worth mentioning context bounds here, as it would cleanup some of the later code examples -->


---

## Decoding CSV with implicits

Declare an implicit decoding function parameter:

```tut:silent
def decodeCsv[A](input: String)
                (implicit f: String â‡’ A): List[List[A]] =
  parseCsv(input).map(_.map(f))

implicit val strToInt: String â‡’ Int = Integer.parseInt
```

--

Running the decoder without a decoding function yields:

```tut:book
decodeCsv[Int](input)
```

---

## The dangers of implicits

> When the compiler finds a type `S` where it expects a type `T`, but there exists an implicit `S` â‡’ `T`
> in scope, it will be applied silently.

This is called implicit conversions and is generally accepted as not a good thing _for the most part_.

<!-- COMMENT:
  as a scala users, we both know what this means.
  depending upon the audience, this might need some fleshing out.
  Why is it only a good thing some of the time?

  More broadly, i'd recomend avoiding generalities in slide content
  as specific items read better / are more valuble for people who did
  not attend the talk in-person (i.e. use your slides to highligh key
  items, and then expand on said items verbally. Readers then get the
  primary points, whilst the in-person audience get the same with added
  exapansion by you the presenter.)
-->



--

```tut:book
def add1(i: Int): Int = i + 1

add1("123")
```

<!-- COMMENT: As you're mentioning this, it might be worth a small mention that
 not only can this lead to unexpected program behaviour, implicit search is currently
 one of the slowest parts of the scala compiller, so having large numbers of imports
 that bring implicit functions into scope will slow the compilation of that unit significantly -->

---

## Finally: type classes

To avoid the pitfalls of arbitrary implicit conversions, declare a dedicated type:

```tut:silent
trait CellDecoder[T] {
  def decode(s: String): T
}

implicit val intDecoder: CellDecoder[Int] = new CellDecoder[Int] {
  override def decode(s: String) = s.toInt
}
```

---

## Type class backed decoder

We can now rewrite `decodeCsv`:

```tut:silent
def decodeCsv[A : CellDecoder](input: String): List[List[A]] =
  parseCsv(input).map(_.map(implicitly.decode))
```

<!-- COMMENT: As per the note earlier in the file this might be better as a context bound?
 certainly, this syntax is common in scala codebases these days, so however you decide
 to poisition this part, I think its worth a mention :-) -->

--

And run it as expected:

```tut:book
decodeCsv[Int](input)
```

---

## Enhancement without inheritance!

<!-- COMMENT -->
Important realisation: _we've added a new feature to `Int`, even though it's `final`_.

--

Think about implementing the same with subtyping:

* create a `Decodable` interface.

--

* have `Int` implement `Decodable`.

--

* but `Int` is final...

--

* create... `WrappedInt` that implements `Decodable` and proxies all calls to `Int`?

--

* ðŸ˜±

## Heterogenous types

`decodeCsv` can decode our input. But what about:

```tut:book
val input = "1,Nicolas\n2,Jessica\n3,Matt"
```

--

This could be decoded as a `(Int, String)`.

Problem: we only know how to decode rows of homogenous types.

---

## `RowDecoder` type class

We need a decoder type class for rows:

```tut:silent
trait RowDecoder[T] {
  def decode(ss: List[String]): T
}
```

--

`decodeCsv` now looks like:

```tut:silent
def decodeCsv[A](input: String)
                (implicit da: RowDecoder[A]): List[A] =
  parseCsv(input).map(da.decode)
```
<!-- COMMENT possible use for context bounds? -->


---

## First, a bit of plumbing

Let's make instance creation less of a pain:

```tut:silent
def cellDecoder[A](f: String â‡’ A) = new CellDecoder[A] {
  override def decode(s: String) = f(s)
}

def rowDecoder[A](f: List[String] â‡’ A) = new RowDecoder[A] {
  override def decode(ss: List[String]) = f(ss)
}

```

--

Also, create a bunch of useful `CellDecoder` instances:

```tut:silent
implicit val intDecoder     = cellDecoder(_.toInt)
implicit val floatDecoder   = cellDecoder(_.toFloat)
implicit val stringDecoder  = cellDecoder(identity)
implicit val booleanDecoder = cellDecoder(_.toBoolean)
```

<!-- COMMENT: earlier in the talk you mentioned the pitfalls of implicit scope,
 so perhaps it would be best to enclose these in an object - module - which is
 then deliberetly brought into scope. Alternitively these could live in the
 companion object of the `CellDecoder`. -->


---

## First attempt at decoding tuples

```tut:silent
implicit val decoder = rowDecoder(row â‡’ (row(0).toInt, row(1)))
```

--

This works:

```tut:book
decodeCsv[(Int, String)](input)
```

--

Disapointing, though: parsing of individual cells is hard-coded.

Didn't we just write a mechanism for that?

---

## Using `CellDecoder`, take 1

Naive implementation:

```tut:silent
implicit val decoder = rowDecoder { row â‡’
  (intDecoder.decode(row(0)),
   stringDecoder.decode(row(1)))
}
```

--

The decoder instances are hard-coded - always a sign that things can be made more generic.
<!-- COMMENT -->

---

## Another look at implicit resolution

There's another rule used in implicit resolution:

> When the compiler looks for an implicit values of type `T` and finds an implicit function that returns a `T` that
> it can call, it will use its return value.

Of interest to us: an implicit function that returns a `T` and that takes implicit parameters that can all be fulfilled.

---

## Using `CellDecoder`, take 2

Better implementation:

```tut:silent
implicit def decoder(implicit di: CellDecoder[Int],
                              ds: CellDecoder[String]) =
  rowDecoder(row â‡’ (di.decode(row(0)), ds.decode(row(1))))
```

--

This produces the desired result:

```tut:book
decodeCsv[(Int, String)](input)
```

--

It works because, when looking for an implicit `RowDecoder[(Int, String)]`, the compiler finds `decoder`, and
realises it can call it.

---

## Using `CellDecoder`, take 3

Why specialise our implicit parameters to `Int` and `String`?

```tut:silent
implicit def decoder[A, B](implicit da: CellDecoder[A],
                                    db: CellDecoder[B]) =
  rowDecoder(row â‡’ (da.decode(row(0)), db.decode(row(1))))
```

--

Take a minute to let that sink in:

_We've written an instance of `RowDecoder[(A, B)]` for all `A` and `B` that have a `CellDecoder` instance_.

--

For example:

```tut:book
decodeCsv[(Float, String)](input)
```

---

## Optional cells

Sometimes, CSV cells are absent or empty:

```tut:book
val input = "1,Nicolas\n,Jessica\n3,Matt"
```

--

This is what `Option` is made for.

```tut:silent
implicit def optionCellDecoder[A](implicit da: CellDecoder[A]) = cellDecoder {
  case "" â‡’ None
  case s  â‡’ Some(da.decode(s))
}
```

---

## Optional cells (2)

This yields the expected result:

```tut:book
decodeCsv[(Option[Int], String)](input)
```

--

_We've written an instance of `CellDecoder[Option[A]]` for all `A` that have a `CellDecoder` instance._

---

## Cells with multiple types

"Sometimes", CSV data is messy:

```tut:book
val input = "1,Nicolas\ntrue,Jessica"
```

--

We have `Either` to represent these cases:
<!-- COMMENT mention biasing? -->

```tut:silent
implicit def eitherCellDecoder[A, B](implicit da: CellDecoder[A],
                                              db: CellDecoder[B]) =
  cellDecoder { s â‡’
    try { Left(da.decode(s)) }
    catch { case _: Throwable â‡’ Right(db.decode(s)) }
  }
```

---

## Cells with multiple types (2)

This yields the expected result:

```tut:book
decodeCsv[(Either[Int, Boolean], String)](input)
```

--

_We've written an instance of `CellDecoder[Either[A, B]]` for all `A` and `B` that have a `CellDecoder` instance._

---

## Complex compositions

```tut:book
val input = "1,Nicolas\nfalse,Jessica\n,Matt"
```

The first column looks like an `Option[Either[Int, Boolean]]`.

--

We already have `Either` and `Option` instances, so we get this for free:

```tut:book
decodeCsv[(Option[Either[Int, Boolean]], String)](input)
```



---

## Collections of values

We have lost the ability to decode a row as `List[Int]` on the way:

```tut:book
val input = "1,2,3\n4,5,6"
```

--

Warning - uses `CanBuildFrom`

--

```tut:silent
import scala.collection.generic.CanBuildFrom

implicit def collectionDecoder[A, C[_]]
               (implicit da: CellDecoder[A],
                         cbf: CanBuildFrom[Nothing, A, C[A]]) =
  rowDecoder(_.foldLeft(cbf.apply()) { (out, s) â‡’
    out += da.decode(s)
  }.result())
```
<!-- COMMENT -->


---

## Collections of values (2)

This yields the expected result, for any collection type:

```tut:book
decodeCsv[List[Int]](input)
```

```tut:book
decodeCsv[Vector[Int]](input)
```

```tut:book
decodeCsv[Array[Int]](input)
```

--

_We've written an instance of `RowDecoder[F[A]]` for any collection `F` and any `A` that has a `CellDecoder` instance._

---

## Case classes

We *could* write a `RowDecoder[A]` instance for any case class `A`â€¦

--

â€¦ but I'd have to use [shapeless](http://shapeless.io), and this would turn into a different talk entirely.
<!-- COMMENT -->

---

## Conclusions

Type classes:
* are great at adding new features to existing types

```tut:silent
implicit val uuidDecoder = cellDecoder(java.util.UUID.fromString)
```

--

* compose implicitly, without having to write any type specific code

```tut:book
implicitly[RowDecoder[List[Either[Int, Option[Either[Boolean, java.util.UUID]]]]]]
```
